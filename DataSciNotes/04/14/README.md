K-Means clustering and Neural Networks

K-means is unsupervised ML = good for finding patterns
Nural networks - supervised ML = good for classification

Feed forward with Back propigation - type used in these examples
Back progigation is only used during training of the model/neurons and adjusts the weight of each node.

Models that have high bias (perform poorly) can be improved by adding features.
Models that have high variance can be improved by removing features.

Features are inputs to the model.

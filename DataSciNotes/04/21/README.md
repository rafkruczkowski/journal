# CW14 04/21 Wends - Algos and Logistic Regression
---
There is a fundamental difference between algorithms, which always produce a correct result, and heuristics, which may usually do a good job but without providing any guarantee.

Reasonable-looking algorithms can easily be incorrect. Algorithm correctness is a property that must be carefully demonstrated.

The heart of any algorithm is an idea. If your idea is not clearly revealed when you express an algorithm, then you are using too low-level a notation to describe it.

Searching for counterexamples is the best way to disprove the correctness of a heuristic.

Basic Data Structures:
- Trees
- Graphs
- Points
- Polygons
- Strings

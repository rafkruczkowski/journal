# CW14 04/08 Thursday - Hypothesis and Inference, Gradient Descent
---
## Models

p - probibility
c - confidence

Better to use Bayesian Inference than probibility with confidence.

## Gradient Descent

```
def sum_of_squares(v):
   return sum(v_i ** 2 for v_i in v)
```
Methods to calculate the gradient:
- Fixed step size
- Shrinking the set size over time
- At each step, choose a value that minimizes the objectives function
